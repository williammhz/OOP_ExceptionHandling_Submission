# 3. EOFException:
A subclass of IOException, it occurs when the end of a file is reached unexpectedly during input. Example: Trying to read data beyond the file's content.

# 4. SQLException (Simulated):
Represents database access errors or issues during SQL operations. Simulated here with a runtime exception to illustrate potential database errors.
